# Regression-model using Tensor flow
This code is a simple implementation of a regression model in TensorFlow. The goal of the model is to predict the output values based on the input values and the provided equation.

## Data set Generation
The first step is to generate the data for the model. The dataset is generated by creating an array of x values between 0 and 4 with a resolution of 0.01. The corresponding y values are then calculated using the equation: y=(1/12)x^4-(1/3)x^3-(7/12)x^2+(5/6)x

## Adding noise 
In order to simulate real-world data, Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 1 is added to the y values.

## Data Splitting
The data is then split into two sets: a training set (60% of the data) and a testing set (40% of the data). The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate the performance of the model.

## Model setup
A sequential model is defined with the following architecture:
   1) One fully-connected layer with 4 neurons, using the ReLU activation function
   2) An output layer with 1 neuron.
   
The model uses the Adam optimizer and the mean squared error (MSE) loss function.

## Model Training
The model is trained on the training data for 500 epochs with a batch size of 35.

## Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated by testing it on the testing data and calculating the MSE and accuracy.

## Logging
The error, MSE, optimizer, number of epochs, batch size, number of neurons, and accuracy are logged in a file named logs.txt

## Plotting
A plot is generated to visualize the true values and predicted values.
